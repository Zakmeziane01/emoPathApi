# Guidelines for Positive Discipline

## Key Principles
1. **Consistency:** Parents should respond to behavior consistently to avoid confusion.  
2. **Empathy First:** Before correcting behavior, acknowledge the child’s emotional state.  
3. **Positive Reinforcement:** Reward the behavior you want to see more of.  
4. **Avoid Harsh Punishment:** Research shows that punitive measures increase aggression and anxiety.  

## When Facing Challenging Behavior:
✅ Stay calm and maintain a neutral tone.  
✅ Describe the problem behavior without judgment.  
✅ Ask the child to express their feelings using words.  
✅ Offer the child two choices for resolution to give them a sense of control.  

## Example:  
Instead of saying, *"Stop throwing your toys!"*  
➡️ Say: *"I see you’re upset. Would you like to calm down by reading a book or drawing?"*
