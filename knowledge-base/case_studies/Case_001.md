# Case Study: Managing Homework Resistance

**Child's Age:** 8 years  
**Behavior:** Refusing to complete homework, arguing with parents  

## Background  
The child began resisting homework assignments after transitioning to a new school. He would often cry, complain of stomach aches, and refuse to sit down to work. 

## Parentâ€™s Initial Response  
- Encouraged the child to "try harder"  
- Removed playtime as a consequence for unfinished homework  

## Recommended Approach  
1. **Reduce Pressure:** Create a predictable homework schedule with 10-minute work blocks followed by 5-minute breaks.  
2. **Positive Reinforcement:** Reward effort, not just completion. Praise the child for sitting down and trying.  
3. **Emotional Check-In:** Before starting, ask how the child is feeling. If they express anxiety, try deep breathing exercises or a short walk.  

## Outcome  
After implementing these changes, the child's resistance decreased. He began completing assignments with fewer complaints, and his anxiety levels reduced.
