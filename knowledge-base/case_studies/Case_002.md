# Case Study: Aggression Toward Siblings

**Child's Age:** 6 years  
**Behavior:** Hitting younger sibling during play  

## Background  
The child displayed increased aggression after the arrival of a new sibling. The child would hit, push, and scream when the younger sibling received attention from parents.  

## Parent’s Initial Response  
- Told the child to "stop being mean"  
- Sent the child to time-out  

## Recommended Approach  
1. **Acknowledge Feelings:** "I can see you’re upset because your brother got more attention. It’s okay to feel upset."  
2. **Teach Alternative Behavior:** Suggest using words like "I feel left out" instead of hitting.  
3. **Reinforce Positive Interaction:** Encourage cooperative play and praise positive sibling interactions.  

## Outcome  
The child's aggressive behavior decreased by 60% over three weeks. Positive sibling interactions increased, and the child began verbalizing emotions instead of acting out physically.
